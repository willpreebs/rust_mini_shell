# rust_mini_shell

Welcome to the my rust mini shell implementation.


## Some info on the project

I wanted a jumping-off point to begin learning rust. I am taking a computer systems in class which is primarily in C.

One of the assignments recently was to write an our own implementation of the linux shell with C. I thought
since rust is good with systems and command line interfaces, tackling this project in rust would be a good idea.


You can find the original project guidelines[here](https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs3650f22/p1.html).

The general idea is to be able to run linux commands in our program and have them execute just like they would in the linux shell.

## My implementation

While I took inspiration from the project, all code written here is my own.

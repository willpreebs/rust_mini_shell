# rust_mini_shell

Welcome to the my rust mini shell implementation. This is my first rust project so keep that in mind :)

## Some info on the project

I wanted a jumping-off point to begin learning rust. I am taking a computer systems class at Northeastern which is taught primarily in C.

One of the assignments recently was to write an our own implementation of the linux shell with C. I thought
since rust is good with systems and command line interfaces, tackling this project in rust would be a good idea.

You can find the original project guidelines [here](https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs3650f22/p1.html).

The general idea is to be able to run linux commands in our program and have them execute just like they would in the linux shell.

## My implementation

All code is solely my own.


## Running the rust mini shell

Running the rust mini shell requires a linux operating system.

1. Make sure you have rustup downloaded. You can find instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
1. Download Zip file
2. Extract
3. Navigate to rust_mini_shell-main in terminal
4. run with 'cargo run'

## Bugs

Sometimes a file will be created with extra characters at the end of the file name. Not sure what causes this yet or how to fix it
